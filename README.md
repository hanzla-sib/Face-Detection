# Face-Detection
Import the required dependencies:

React and its hooks (useRef, useState) are imported from the 'react' package.
faceLandmarksDetection is imported from the @tensorflow-models/face-landmarks-detection package. This package provides the face landmarks detection functionality.
Script is imported from the 'react-load-script' package. It is used to load external scripts dynamically.
Create the FaceDetection component:

This component is a functional component that renders the face detection functionality.
Inside the component, there are state variables defined using the useState hook:
selectedImage: Stores the URL of the selected image.
canvasRef: Ref to access the canvas element.
facemeshLoaded: Indicates whether the face detection model is loaded.
model: Stores the loaded face detection model.
The handleImageUpload function is triggered when an image is selected for upload. It updates the selectedImage state with the URL of the selected image.
The handleScriptLoad function is called when the external scripts are loaded successfully. It sets the facemeshLoaded state to true.
The performFaceDetection function is called when the "Detect Faces" button is clicked. It performs face detection on the selected image using the loaded model.
The return statement contains JSX elements that define the structure and layout of the component.
The <h1> element displays the heading for the face detection section.
The <input> element allows the user to select an image for face detection.
The selected image is displayed using an <img> element within a <div>. The image is also overlaid with a <canvas> element where the detected face landmarks will be drawn.
The "Detect Faces" button triggers the performFaceDetection function when clicked.
The <Script> components load the necessary TensorFlow.js and face-landmarks-detection scripts from CDN.
To run the code:

Make sure you have React and the required dependencies installed in your project.
Copy the code into a file named FaceDetection.jsx or any other appropriate file name with a .jsx extension.
Include the necessary imports for React and other dependencies at the top of the file.
Use the FaceDetection component in your application as needed.
Run your React project using the appropriate build and run commands (npm start, yarn start, etc.) to see the face detection functionality in action.
